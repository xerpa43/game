This is a simple game which I created while learning React, It helped to understant react hooks in general.

SO YOU HAVE TO GUESS A RANDOM WORD WHICH IS GENERATED EVERTIME THE PAGE LOADS
---WHAT ARE THOSE COLORS------
YELLOW - THE LETTER IS IN THE WORD BUT IT'S IN WRONG POSITION
GREEN - THE LETTER IS IN CORRECT POSITION
BLACK - THAT LETTER IS'T IN THE WORD




THANK YOU
